                             <p> The Academic Success Foundation (TAS) has made a significant impact by empowering over 10,000 senior high school students with mentorship, career guidance, and essential skills training. Through its initiatives, students have gained clarity about their academic and career paths, improved their confidence, and developed practical skills in STEM and AgricTech fields. TAS’s efforts have led to increased student engagement, better academic performance, and more informed decisions about further education or entrepreneurship. The foundation’s focus on holistic development, including mental health support, has contributed to creating a well-rounded support system that enhances both personal and professional growth.</p>
