Inspired by personal experiences, co-founder Agnes Atanga, along with like-minded partners, initiated TAST to provide students with the necessary resources and motivation to stay in school and excel academically.</p>
                                <p><strong> Our vision </strong> is to create a future where every young person has the opportunity to reach their full potential through access to quality education, mentorship, and technological skills.
                                </p>
                                  <p>
                                  <strong> Our mission  </strong> is to provide comprehensive support to students especially those underrepresented thus young women and persons with disabilities, equipping them with the tools, guidance, and resources necessary to succeed academically and professionally.</p>
                                <p>Since its inception, TAST has launched three flagship programs that have significantly impacted student lives.</p>
